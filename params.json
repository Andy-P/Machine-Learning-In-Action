{"name":"Machine Learning in Action - in F#","tagline":"","body":"### Project objectives.\r\nThis project is inspired by the book \"[Machine Learning in Action](http://www.manning.com/pharrington/)\", by Peter Harrington, published at Manning Publications Co. The project objective is to convert the book samples from Python to F#.\r\n\r\n### Part 1: Classification\r\n* Chapter 2: k-Nearest Neighbors, [Part 1](http://clear-lines.com/blog/post/Nearest-Neighbor-Classification-part-1.aspx) and [Part 2](http://clear-lines.com/blog/post/Nearest-Neighbor-Classification-Part-2.aspx)\r\n* Chapter 3: [Decision Trees](http://clear-lines.com/blog/post/Decision-Tree-classification.aspx)\r\n* Chapter 4: [Naive Bayes classification](http://clear-lines.com/blog/post/Naive-Bayes-Classification.aspx)\r\n* Chapter 5: [Logistic regression](http://clear-lines.com/blog/post/Logistic-Regression.aspx)\r\n* Chapter 6: Support Vector Machines: [part 1](http://clear-lines.com/blog/post/Support-Vector-Machine-in-FSharp-work-in-progress.aspx) (naive implementation), [part 2](http://clear-lines.com/blog/post/Support-Vector-Machine-in-FSharp.aspx) (SMO, Kernels). _(currently works, but needs some performance tuning)._\r\n* Chapter 7: [AdaBoost](http://clear-lines.com/blog/post/AdaBoost-classifier-in-FSharp.aspx)\r\n\r\n### Part 3: Unsupervised Learning\r\n* Chapter 10: K-means clustering. [part 1](http://clear-lines.com/blog/post/K-Means-Clustering-in-FSharp.aspx).\r\n\r\n### Part 4: Additional Tools\r\n* Chapter 14: Simplifying data with the singular value decomposition.
